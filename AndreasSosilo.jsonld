My goal is to ensure that every vote contributes to a stronger, more innovative Cardano."

Iâ€™m also dedicated to helping the community learn about DRep, Direct Voting, Governance Actions and CIP-1694.

I have strong knowledge of the Cardano blockchain and have hosted and spoken at Cardano Summit community-led events in Jakarta from 2021 to 2023. Additionally, I am passionate about sharing knowledge on using open-source tools to build DApps and smart contracts on Cardano, while also growing the Indonesian Cardano Developer Community to increase the number of local developers."
